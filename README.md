# BearcatRecords
A visualization of my physical media collection and a blog about the records and cassettes I seek to buy. Made with HTML/CSS (Bootstrap 4.5)

To be continously updated with each addition to my media collection and/or stylistic changes as I learn more techniques with HTML/CSS/Bootstrap.

I own another version of this hosted on BearcatRecords.com which was created with WordPress and the Elementor plugin. That website may or may not be hosted in the future, depending on if I want to pay for hosting. I decided to remake it from scratch in HTML/CSS to preserve it forever, host it for free, and practice my skills.
